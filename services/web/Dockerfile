# So, we started with a slim-buster-based Docker image for Python 3.9.5. We then set a working directory along with two environment variables:
# set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1 
# Prevents Python from writing pyc files to disc (equivalent to python -B option)
# -B If given, Python wonâ€™t try to write .pyc files on the import of source modules.

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
# Prevents Python from buffering stdout and stderr (equivalent to python -u option)
# -u Force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered. This option has no effect on the stdin stream.
